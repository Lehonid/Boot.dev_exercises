"""
FIND MAX
INFINITY
The built-in float() function can create a numeric floating point value of negative infinity. Because every value will be greater than negative infinity, we can use it to help us accomplish our goal of finding the max value. I've added it for you as the starting value of max_so_far.

negative_infinity = float('-inf')
positive_infinity = float('inf')

ASSIGNMENT
Our players want a way to see their strongest attack from their last combat. Let's add another function to analyze data from our combat log.

Complete the find_max function that looks at each number in the nums list and returns the maximum value. If no maximum is found, it just returns negative infinity.

For example:

max_val = find_max([100, 10, 22])
print(max_val)
# 100

def find_max(nums):
    max_so_far = float("-inf")
    pass
