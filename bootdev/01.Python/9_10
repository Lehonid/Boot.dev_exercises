"""

COUNTING THE ITEMS IN A LIST
Remember that we can iterate over all the elements in a list using a loop. For example, the following code will print each item in the sports list.

for i in range(0, len(sports)):
    print(sports[i])

ASSIGNMENT
Our players need a way to see how many copies of a specific item they have within their inventory!

Let's finish the get_item_counts function. Within the loop, check if the items are a Potion, Bread, or Shortsword, then add up h&Ã©ow many there are of each by incrementing the potion_count, bread_count and shortsword_count variables respectively.

TIP
The example shows you how to access the values in a list. Combine this with what you know about comparison and assignment operators to complete the assignment.
